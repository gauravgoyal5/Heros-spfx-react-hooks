## heros

This web part interacts with a Heros list and a Hero Teams list to display information about fictitious game characters and the lineups you've placed them in. The goal of this part is as a coding exercise on properly constructing SPFx web parts that need to make multiple api calls throughout its existance while leveraging the new React Hook methodology.

### Building the code

git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
