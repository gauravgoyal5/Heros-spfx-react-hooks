## Heros

This web part interacts with a Heros list and a Hero Teams list to display information about fictitious game characters and the lineups you've placed them in. The goal of this part is as a coding exercise on properly constructing SPFx web parts that need to make multiple api calls throughout its existence while leveraging the new React Hook methodology.

### Setting up the lists

PnP provisioning xml templates have been provided in the Provisioning folder that you can incorporate into your Sharepoint site.

From the root, go to Provisioning to get the files and incorporate them into your own PnP provisioning template.

```bash
cd Provisioning
```

Here's a quick writeup for provisioning, if you need help: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/get-and-apply-pnp-template-of-a-specific-list-or-library-using-pnp-provisioning-engine

### Building the code

To try out the web part, pull the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhomol/Heros-spfx-react-hooks.git
```

Navigate down to the WebParts directory

```bash
cd WebParts
```

Update the npm packages and ensure that gulp is installed globally

```bash
npm i
npm i -g gulp
```

Finally serve up the part.  My advice would be to try this out through your own tenant's workbench, since you will need lists to access.

```bash
gulp serve
```

Happy Hacking!

### Here's some boilerplate from MS when we first build our Web Parts :)

This package produces the following:

- lib/\* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
- dist/\* - the bundled script, along with other resources
- deploy/\* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options after your done messing with it

```bash
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship
```
